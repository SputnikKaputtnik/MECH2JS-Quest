/**
 * Draws the game's world with three.js.
 *
 * What is drawn is what the original draws. The main view (sync, the
 * drawing half of vfx_video_sub_010490): first the backdrop, the tree under
 * backdropNode (render_scene_tree_sorted, far clip lifted), into
 * backdropScene, which the caller renders before clearing the depth buffer -
 * so the world always paints over it, as it does when drawn after; then the
 * objects on worldRootNode's list (render_object_list); then, in the cockpit
 * view, cockpitHeadNode's tree - the player's own head, the cockpit shell -
 * into cockpitScene, which the caller renders last after clearing the depth
 * buffer, since the original paints it after (so over) the whole world. The
 * alt list holds hidden objects and the aux list objects set aside. The
 * extra views the HUD asks for (render/passes/indexedView.ts) draw one
 * render_object_list (drawList) or one render_scene_tree_sorted (drawTree)
 * into scene.
 *
 * Every pass runs the render-state block's hooks as they stand
 * (render/pipeline/hooks.ts): objectCullHook per object (the backdrop and
 * cockpit passes install their own, 0x3f780 and 0x3f970), the level-of-detail
 * mesh chosen as object_draw_lod_mesh chooses it from the object's view
 * depth, each polygon's colour word from polygonDrawHook at the depth key
 * the clipper gives it (render/pipeline/drawPipeline.ts), and what that word
 * becomes from poly_fill_dispatch and polygonFillHook
 * (render/pipeline/fillDispatch.ts): a fill, an outline, or both - per
 * frame, on the CPU. Objects the cull rejects and polygons the clipper does
 * not queue are not drawn.
 *
 * Geometry: an object with a scene node keeps model-space vertices and takes
 * the node's world transform as its matrix; an object without one (static
 * scenery, parent -2) had its world vertices baked at load
 * (object_transform_now) and is drawn from those. Each polygon has slots for
 * its fan (one triangle more than it needs, for a near-clipped shape), a
 * mode 0x3000 code also a sprite quad, and - built the first time one is
 * needed - line slots for its outline.
 *
 * Polygons crossing the near plane are drawn from the clipper's own records
 * (clip_vertex_at_near_plane), at the game's near clip, which lies beyond
 * three.js's near plane - so the GPU never clips, and nothing it would
 * interpolate differently at a cut reaches the screen. Their outlines run
 * through the same records.
 *
 * A mode 0x3000 fill is a sprite (see materials/indexedMaterial.ts): its
 * quad's corners are built on screen by the vertex shader from the
 * polygon's p and q vertices (spriteVertices), or on the map from q and r.
 * One whose polygon crosses the near plane is not drawn (DIVERGENCE: the
 * original builds it from the clip records, which then carry interpolated
 * u, v).
 *
 * Faces are not culled by the GPU: the clipper's own back-face test (the
 * first vertex against the stored normal) decides, as in the original.
 *
 * DIVERGENCE: a depth buffer replaces the original's per-polygon painter's
 * sort (render_scene_tree_sorted, render_draw_depth_sorted); objects with
 * load flag 0x1 ("always behind") are drawn first without depth writes to
 * approximate it. Within a polygon the outline is drawn over the fill, as
 * poly_fill_dispatch draws them in that order.
 *
