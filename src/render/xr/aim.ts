/**
 * How far away the thing under the reticle is, for the VR view's reticle
 * plane (xrRig.ts placeLifted): the nearest of
 *
 *  - the drawn world: three.js raycast against the main view's meshes (the
 *    caller's list, the player's own mech left out) - buildings, mechs,
 *    scenery;
 *  - the terrain: world_object_raycast against every walkmesh (objectClass
 *    5) on the world chain, the hills the mechs walk on - not all of them
 *    are drawn as meshes the raycast above can meet;
 *  - the flat ground: MW2's ground is a fill below the horizon, not
 *    geometry, so a ray below the horizon meets a plane at the height the
 *    player stands on (world_ground_height_near under the player).
 *
 * Not world_raycast itself: it also answers for class-0 boxes, collision
 * volumes that are not always drawn - in AMY_SCN1 one stands 6 m ahead of
 * the start position's eye, under a reticle that sees open desert.
 *
 * The game's queries leave their normals in the collision globals, which
 * the sim reads after its own queries; every one made here is between
 * passes, so the globals are put back as they were.
