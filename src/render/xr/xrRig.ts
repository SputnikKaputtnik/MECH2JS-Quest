/**
 * The pilot's seat in VR: where the headset's eyes stand while the game's
 * viewer moves the cockpit.
 *
 * The rig is an Object3D posed as the game's viewer (cameraFromViewer, the
 * same pose the flat view looks through), and the XR camera is its child:
 * three's WebXRManager composes the head's pose, in the 'local' reference
 * space (seated, the origin where the head started), onto the camera's
 * parent. So the head moves inside a cockpit the game moves.
 *
 * The game moves its viewer once per pass of main's loop - 20 a second at
 * the default loop rate - while a headset draws 72 to 120 frames a second.
 * A cockpit stepping at 20 Hz around a smoothly tracked head is the quickest
 * way to make a pilot ill, so the rig is drawn one pass behind, between the
 * last two passes' poses (position lerped, orientation slerped). A jump no
 * interpolation should cross (the external view, a new mission) snaps.
 *
 * Three things the flat view can leave to the screen need the rig in
 * stereo:
 *
 *  - The cull. object_cull_main_view has no side test - only the far sphere
 *    and depth along the view's forward row against the near clip - so what
 *    it rejects is what lies behind the viewer. Behind the game's viewer is
 *    where a turned head looks, so cullViewer is the game's viewer standing
 *    at the head instead (as the editor's scene camera does,
 *    viewerFromCamera); the sides are the GPU's frustum clip, per eye. Its
 *    far distance is pushed out as the Modern view's is
 *    (render/viewSettings.ts farther): at the original's, buildings and
 *    hills popped in and out in plain view.
 *
 *  - The cockpit shell. It is painted over the world after a depth clear,
 *    so on a screen its size never mattered, and it is modelled at the
 *    mech's own scale: metres to ten metres from the eye (xrSettings.ts has
 *    the measurement). In stereo that is a canopy the size of a room.
 *    cockpitMatrix scales it about the eye by settings.cockpitScale: every
 *    point stays on its ray from the eye, so the flat picture is unchanged
 *    and only its depth changes. It also carries the shell from the pass's
 *    eye to the interpolated rig, so it stays rigid around the head.
 *    (Correction: the first cut took the shell to be centimetres from the
 *    eye and enlarged it 8x.)
 *
 *  - The HUD. See passes/hudOverlay.ts: a plane settings.hudDistance ahead
 *    in the rig, settings.hudScale of the game's field of view wide. The
 *    layers that mark the world (the reticle, the target marker) are not on
 *    it: placeLifted puts each on a plane of its own across the game's whole
 *    field of view, far out. The target marker is posed at the pass's eye -
 *    not the interpolated rig - because the game drew it from that eye onto
 *    a world standing where that pass left it, so it lies on its target.
 *    The reticle is the mech's own aim, so it rides the rig with the
 *    cockpit (placeCarried). (Correction: it was first posed at the pass's
 *    eye too, and stood a pass ahead of the cockpit, jittering against it.)
 *
 *  - The mech's own parts. The player's arms and guns outside the cockpit
 *    are world objects, drawn where the last pass left them; the view is a
 *    pass behind, so they jumped ahead of the cockpit at every pass.
 *    SceneRenderer.carryOwned moves them with the cockpit scene's carry.
